the first 2 lines are constants for players and teams to get the information needed

the next few lines is for the menu and will allow you to choose what route you want to take weather it be to quit or to display the team stats i use if to choose which one will be used and depending on the answer it will print said answer

the next section is the team you will choose depending on the team that is chosen names will be randomly picked and used to create a team i used if here as well for the different teams

the clear data is hard for me to explain it gathers information and adds it to the lists and players

the balance_teams is where the the names needed for the team come into play

the display stats are where the randomly generated names for the team that was picked appear and after the team has appeared you are asked if you wish to continue to the exit by pressing 1
